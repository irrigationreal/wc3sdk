# Resources (external reference repos)

These are **not vendored** into this repo. They can be useful for orientation and for finding initial
entry points / addresses to investigate in Ghidra.

## Reference links

- TinkerWorX/warcraftIII
  - https://github.com/TinkerWorX/warcraftIII
- Still4/War3Trainer

## How to use them locally (optional)

If you want local checkouts for searching/reading, clone them into `resources/vendor/` (which is ignored by git).

```bash
./scripts/fetch_resources.sh
```

## Notes / reminders

- Respect each repo’s license.
- Don’t copy proprietary game code/data into this repository.
- Prefer extracting *ideas* (feature list, workflows, search terms, symbol names) rather than pasting large code blocks.
