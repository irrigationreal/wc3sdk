# Ghidra notes (living doc)

Keep this file as a collection of practical workflows that help new work ramp up quickly.

## Import conventions

- Always record the target identity (see `docs/targets/`).
- Use a fresh Ghidra project per target build.
- Prefer note-taking that describes behavior and relationships, not pasted code.

## What to capture

- Subsystem boundaries: UI, game loop, simulation, networking, scripting
- Stable identifiers: strings, RTTI, vtables, exported functions
- Validation ideas: invariants we can check at runtime before reading/writing memory
